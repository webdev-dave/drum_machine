# Drum Machine

I have always wanted to try building a drum machine from scratch. This project will help broaden my understanding and capabilities in both python and in music production. I will start off the project build modeled after a course I found on free code camp and will expand upon that. We'll see where this projects ends up. Wish me luck ;)

I am following along this tutorial [Tutorial Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3J3PZj0zi0)
